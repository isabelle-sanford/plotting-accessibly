# to do

- Figure out how to add alt text
- Control axis tick font sizes
- Add caption
- Do error checking for whether various things exist
  - for axis labels - maybe require annotations dict, and if it doesn't exist you need to put None?
- figure out resizeability??
- color palettes - for now I guess just design them and have the ability to multicolor bars
- should the hover actually show quantity?
- Add optional patterns to bars (i.e. not just color distinguishing)

Note down Tol info (which print friendly etc)
